I am a third year engineering science student at Somerville College, Oxford. I am studying modules in mechanical and information engineering. Outside of my studies I enjoy spending time outdoors, running, sailing, climbing and walking my dog.

In addition to my studies I have also worked on different extracurricular projects such as the Qronk quadruped robot, a Raspberry Pi Pico based tracker for a high altitude balloon and an infrared dual colour pyrometry setup for the impact engineering research group at the university.
